Main models
===========

This area contains the main models for boxes that correspond to known versions
of the OpenTRV PCB. The name of the model reflects that version. For instance,
the radiator control that corresponds to PCB v0p2 Rev 1 is modelled in the file
called `radiator_control-v0p2_rev1.scad`.

Each model has a specific settings file that follows the same convention. For
instance, the settings file for the model above is
`radiator_control-v0p2_rev1-settings.scad`.

In addition, some generic configuration settings can be tuned by changing the
values in the `user-settings.scad` file.
