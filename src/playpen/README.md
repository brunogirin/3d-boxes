Playpen models
==============

This area contains models that have been created to experiment with
particular designs and shapes. Some of those models may be migrated to the
main area onces they've matured enough. Most files come with a correponding
settings file. For instance, the settings file for `box-dd1.scad` is
`settings-dd1.scad`.
